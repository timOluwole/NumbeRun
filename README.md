# NumbeRun
This project was built during the 2016 AcornAccelerator.

NumbeRun is a platformer game wherein KS3 maths questions are intermittently asked of the player.
Points are awarded as the player runs along the platformer and also based on how quickly they answer questions.

This repository only contains the game prototypes themselves. The tutorials are being built separately.
